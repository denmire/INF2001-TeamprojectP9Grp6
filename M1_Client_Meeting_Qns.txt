Finalised questions for client on 7th September
===Technical questions===
What are the key functionalities/features of this web application should be prioritised?
    - job allocation, availability indication, workload viewing (jobs assigned, num of hours worked for the week)
Operations flow
    pilots check in --> flight prep --> fly to dst --> rest? prep for immediate flight? --> repeat?
Planning starts every thursday
    - plan from when to when? (eg. next week monday to sunday or ?)
Availabilities updated by wednesday
    - for those who did not update on time, what is their default status? (eg. indicate as available or unavailable)
    - lock updating of availability to prevent confusion when planning? (eg. lock from thurs - sunday or lock upcoming week's availability)
Make their assignments such that staff should not need to travel between routes and planes do not stay on the ground for more than three hours
    - clarify what does it mean that they should not need to travel between routes? (eg switch terminals? switch boarding gates? switch airports?)
        - based on manpower constraints, there might be issues here tho
    - less than 3 hours of waiting time (parking time? what is it doing? does it include right after landing/arriving?)
Indication of being unable to fulfil assigned jobs
    - requires popup warning of having discussed this w their manager?
    - put in reasoning for rejecting?
The manager should be able to view up to three staff availability and any relevant information
to make the job assignment easier on the job allocation page
    - up to 3 per week or per day? (clarify and confirm that it's the max)
    - which staff to prioritise and in what order? (in order of location then workload then ... etc?)
Is training considered a job assignment/slotted into job allocation? or will it be handled separately irrelevant from the web application
    - working hours are clocked
    - is training done as OJT on the plane?
===Visual questions===
Color themes?
Design inspirations you'd like us to refer to?
What style would you want the web application landing page to be in? (E.g dashboard, login page, etc)
